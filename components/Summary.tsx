        1. Introduction Dear Class of 2024, it is an honor to be here with you
        today at Dartmouth. I am filled with excitement and gratitude to be
        given the opportunity to address such a prestigious institution. I must
        admit, I never imagined that my second time setting foot on a college
        campus would result in me receiving a doctorate degree. It is truly an
        unexpected and humbling honor. I am grateful to President Beilock, the
        Board of Trustees, and the faculty for bestowing this recognition upon
        me. I am truly touched and will do my best not to choke during this
        speech. And to think, I will be leaving here as "Dr. Roger" - a title I
        never thought I would have. Thank you all for this incredible honor.
      </p>

        2. Reflection on Dartmouth As I stand here today, I must admit that I am
        a little outside my comfort zone. This is not my usual scene, and these
        are definitely not my usual clothes. I can't help but wonder if this is
        how Dartmouth students dress every day. The academic robe is quite
        difficult to move in, especially for someone like me who has worn shorts
        for the past 35 years. But I must say, the "Big Green" color scheme does
        suit me quite well. And speaking of green, I couldn't come to Dartmouth
        without mentioning the infamous game of beer pong. I have heard that
        Dartmouth is the birthplace of this popular drinking game. Whether it is
        considered a sport or a way of life, I must say, Dartmouth is the
        Wimbledon of pong. I even had the chance to practice my shots with some
        of you and I am seriously considering turning pro.
      </p>

        3.Experiences at Dartmouth My time at Dartmouth has been nothing short
        of amazing. I have had the opportunity to experience some of the
        activities that make this campus so special. From hitting balls at the
        Boss Tennis Center with my kids, to climbing the Baker Tower and taking
        in the breathtaking views, to visiting the library and seeing the Dr.
        Seuss books, and of course, indulging in some delicious chocolate chip
        cookies from FoCo and an EBA's chicken sandwich from Lou's. I must say,
        the mountains here remind me so much of the Swiss Alps, just a little
        shorter. But what truly makes Dartmouth special is the people. I have
        been welcomed with open arms and have felt right at home thanks to the
        warm and friendly community. And I must give a special shoutout to my
        friend Tony G., Class of '93, who has shown me just how loyal and
        passionate Dartmouth students are.{" "}

        4. Lessons for Graduates As I stand before you, I can't help but reflect
        on my own transition in life. Just like you, I have recently graduated -
        from tennis. And I must say, the word "retired" doesn't sit well with
        me. But just like you, I am figuring out what's next. And I must say,
        it's not an easy question to answer. But I have learned a few lessons
        along the way that I hope will be useful to you as you embark on your
        own journey beyond Dartmouth. The first lesson is that "effortless" is a
        myth. People often described my playing style as effortless, but little
        did they know the hard work and dedication it took to make it look easy.
        I spent years whining, swearing, and throwing my racket before I learned
        to keep my cool. So remember, nothing worth having comes easy. The
        second lesson is to embrace the unknown. It's okay not to have all the
        answers right now. Just like I am still figuring out what's next for me,
        it's okay for you to not have a concrete plan for the rest of your life.
        And finally, learn to keep calm in the face of challenges. As a tennis
        player, I had to learn to keep my cool under pressure, and I believe
        this is a valuable skill to have in any aspect of life. So graduates, as
        you move on to the next chapter of your lives, remember these lessons
        and never stop striving for greatness. Congratulations, Class of 2024!

        5. Mental Discipline Mental discipline is a crucial aspect of success in
        any field, and it is especially important in sports like tennis. As
        Roger Federer experienced, even the most physically fit and talented
        players can struggle with maintaining mental discipline during a match.
        The ability to stay focused, clear-minded, and disciplined for extended
        periods of time is what sets apart the great players from the good ones.
        However, mental discipline is not something that comes easily or
        naturally to everyone. It requires constant training and practice, just
        like physical skills. Challenges to mental discipline can come in many
        forms, such as fatigue, distractions, and pressure from opponents. But
        with dedication and hard work, mental discipline can be improved and
        honed. Federer's realization of the importance of mental discipline led
        him to train even harder and ultimately achieve great success in his
        career.
      </p>
      <p className="text-justify p-4 my-4 bg-slate-600 text-white rounded-md">
        6. Hard Work and Effort There is a common misconception that success
        comes effortlessly to those who are naturally talented. However, as
        Roger Federer's experience shows, this is far from the truth. Talent
        alone is not enough to reach the top in any field. Hard work and effort
        are essential components of success. In tennis, as in life, discipline
        and grit are just as important as natural talent. Federer's "effortless"
        playing style was often misunderstood as a lack of hard work, but in
        reality, he was constantly pushing himself to improve and outwork his
        opponents. This determination and grit are what allowed him to overcome
        challenges and achieve greatness. Talent may give someone a head start,
        but it is hard work and effort that ultimately lead to success
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="text-justify p-4 my-4 bg-slate-400 text-white rounded-md">
        7. Overcoming Challenges In any competitive field, challenges and
        obstacles are inevitable. In tennis, players must constantly face
        physical and mental challenges, such as injuries, illness, and pressure
        from opponents. However, as Roger Federer has shown, it is possible to
        overcome these challenges and still achieve success. Winning despite
        obstacles is a true testament to one's mental toughness and
        determination. Federer's ability to manage injuries and illness, and
        still perform at the highest level, is a testament to his mental
        strength and resilience. He also faced tough opponents and pressure
        situations, but his mental toughness and belief in himself allowed him
        to come out on top. These challenges may seem daunting, but with the
        right mindset and determination, they can be overcome.

        8. The Importance of Mental Strength In the world of professional
        tennis, mental strength is just as important as physical strength. As
        Roger Federer reflects on his career, he emphasizes the importance of
        focusing on the present moment, dealing with self-doubt, and learning
        from defeats. In the midst of a match, it is crucial to stay in the
        present and not get caught up in the end result. Federer also
        acknowledges the presence of self-doubt, even among the top-ranked
        players, and emphasizes the need to overcome it in order to succeed. And
        perhaps most importantly, he stresses the importance of learning from
        defeats and using them as opportunities for growth and improvement. In
        the fast-paced and competitive world of professional tennis, mental
        strength is a key component to success.{" "}
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="text-justify p-4 my-4 bg-slate-600 text-white rounded-md">
        9. The Reality of Perfection In a sport like tennis, where every point
        counts, the idea of perfection can seem like the ultimate goal. However,
        as Roger Federer points out, perfection is impossible to achieve. In his
        1,526 singles matches, he won almost 80% of them, but only 54% of the
        points. This goes to show that even the best players in the world are
        not perfect. Instead, Federer emphasizes the importance of adaptability
        and hard work. In a game where every shot counts, it is crucial to be
        able to adapt to different situations and constantly work on improving
        one's skills. Federer's success is a testament to the power of hard work
        and the reality of imperfection.

        10. Life Beyond the Court While tennis may have been Roger Federer's
        career, he recognizes that life extends far beyond the boundaries of a
        tennis court. With a court size of only 2,106 square feet, Federer
        acknowledges the limitations of the sport and the importance of balance
        in life. Despite his dedication and success in tennis, he never lost
        sight of his desire to explore the world and give back to others.
        Through his foundation, he has helped millions of children in need and
        has used his success to make a positive impact on the world. Federer's
        life serves as a reminder that there is more to life than just one's
        career, and that success can be used for the greater good.
